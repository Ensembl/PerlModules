* Hum::Ace::
Aimed to be light-weight representation of transcripts held in acedb
** ::AceText
+ uses Ace.pm raw_query to talk to sgifaceserver
  + s = sockets, not RPC
  + gif = has extensions to provide gifs, and queries to do that
** ::Assembly
+ has many SubSeq
+ express_data_fetch method
+ /doesn't/ have a list of Locus objects, you must recurse
+ set_SubSeq_Locus_level_errors
  + holds QC, collected from the lower level objects
  + then used to render transcripts in red
** ::Method
+ associated with
  + ZMap styles
  + biotypes
  + status (known, novel, predicted, putative...)
** ::Sequence::DNA
+ slice genomic
** ::SeqFeature::Simple
+ PolyA sites / signals
+ etc.
** ::SubSeq
+ Represents a transcript
  + Validates its H:A:Exons
  + has_a H:A:Locus, which may be shared with other SubSeqs
+ Probably has the most methods
+ Caches QC results
+ is_archival - indicates successful save to Otter
+ has an OTTID
+ get_all_exons method
  + returns them sorted start..end
** ::Locus
+ has an OTTID
** ::Clone
+ assembly_data
+ should become irrelevant e.g. for WGS
** ::Exon
+ has an OTTID
** Common
+ ace_string method
  + turn the object into an Ace string
  + can be used to write to acedb
    + we must also send the change to ZMap, this is separate
  + usually like
    Class "name"
    -D OldExon
    -D ...
    Class "name"
    Exon x y
    ...
  + also used to compare with previous instances, to detect changes
+ having an OTTID
  + various mechanisms to preserve it whenever possible
  + used during write_region to detect modified genes
+ uses "end < start" to indicate reverse-strand object
  + doesn't work when length = (end - start + 1) == 1
    + e.g. an exon truncated at the edge of the region
+ QC (quality control == error detection) happens after loading the
  data, because we don't want exceptions raised until we're ready
