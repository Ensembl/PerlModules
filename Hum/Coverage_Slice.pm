=head2 Hum::Coverage_Slice module

	Has various methods concerned with calculating the coverage of the slice by the features.

	Get features which are mostly not in "deep regions".

=head2 get_feature_exposure

	Get the "exposure" of features
	This is currently designed to give the # of bases that each feature has "exposed", prioritising (by default) by percent_id
	This won't work for any feature not returning percent_id, but it could be made more general.
	Alternatively, an explicit "sort function" can be sent. Currently, this is only "Dust", which prioritises Dust.
	Returns a hash indexed on dbID of features.
	
	If "$restrict_features_to_slice_coordinates" is set, this prevents any feature starting before the slice or extending past it
