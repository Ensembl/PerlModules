=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $ebi_ftp = Hum::EBI_FTP->new();
    $ebi_ftp->put_project( $project_name, $file_name );

=head1 METHODS

Methods are fatal on failure.

=over 4

=item new

Returns a new ftp connection to 'ftp1.ebi.ac.uk',
having logged in with the B<login> and
B<password> specified in the I<~/.netrc> file. 
(A differnt machine name may be provided as an
argument to new.)

=item put_project

The first argument to put_project is the name of
the project as known by the EBI, and the second
is the name of the file on the local filesystem. 
The name of the file on the remote machine will
be of the form:

    YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_Projectname

and is returned by the method.  The name is
generated automatically, and is checked to make
sure that it is unique before transfer.
